    <string name="description_default_text_Overview">Cose a caso. Believing they have left behind 
        shadowy figures from their past, newlyweds Christian and Ana fully embrace an inextricable 
        connection and shared life of luxury. But just as she steps into her role as Mrs. Grey and 
        he relaxes into an unfamiliar stability, new threats could jeopardize their happy ending 
        before it even begins. A lot of people think that none is able to think to the future.
        Three monkey are on the top of the tree, two in the middle, and one on the bottom. The one
        under the tree is the one that rules the others. I remember when it happen, the sky crushed
        on the head of the saviors, too much busy to sleep and eat. Remember the day I set you free.
        I told you can olways count on me darling.</string>
